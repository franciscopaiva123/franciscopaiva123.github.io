**Abstract** Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing equates to approximately 11-19% of reported global
fisheries production and leads to losses of roughly $10-23.5 billion in value yearly. This work aims to combat
this issue by developing two models for the classification of fishing activities from AIS and VMS data. It utilizes
two deep learning concepts namely Convolutinal Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory with
a Fully Convolutional Network (LSTM-FCN) for classifying fishing gears and predicting fishing activity. The
data used for the training and testing of the models is supplied by the Portuguese Navy and encompasses around
12000 vessels monitored in Portuguese waters from December 2021 up until December 2023. Both models are
then evaluated and interpreted accordingly. In this manner, this work provides a way to aid in monitoring,
identifying, and classifying fishing vessel activities.
